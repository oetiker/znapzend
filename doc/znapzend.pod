=head1 DESCRIPTION

ZnapZend is a snapshot based zfs backup daemon creating snapshots on a
scheduled basis on the source filesystem and on destination filesystems.

ZnapZend reads its configuration from custom properties in the fileset. Use
L<znapzendzetup> to set these properties.

=over

=item B<-d>, B<--debug>

talk a lot while running. Sends debug messages to stderr.

=item B<-n>, B<--noaction>

don't do any actions which have lasting effect. Ideal to try our new new
configurations together with B<--debug>

=item B<--nodestroy>

do all changes to the filesystem except destroy old snapshots

=item B<--logto>={B<syslog::>I<facility>|I<filepath>}

send logs out to either syslog or a logfile. Default is to send logs to
B<syslog::daemon> when runing daemonized. When running in debug mode, the
logs will go to STDERR by default.

Examples:

 --logto=/var/log/znapzend.log
 --logto=syslog::daemon

=item B<--loglevel>={B<debug>|B<info>|B<warning>|B<err>|B<alert>}

Define the log level when logging to file. Default is debug.

=item B<--pidfile>=I<path>

write a pid file when running in daemon mode
B<pidfile> defaults to I</var/run/znapzend.pid> if no pidfile is given

=item B<--daemonize>

Fork into the background.

=item B<--runonce>=I<fileset>

run one round on source I<fileset>. This is very useful for testing.
Use it in connection with B<--noaction> and B<--debug> while
testing your new configuration

=item B<--features>=I<feature1>,I<feature2>,...

enables enhanced zfs features not supported by all zfs implementations.
Do not enable features unless you are sure your zfs supports it

Available features:

=over

=item oracleMode

working around the following zfs issues we have seen on oracle:

=over

=item *

The multi snapshot destroy syntax is not available. So stick to destroying
them individually.

=item *

Sometimes a snapshot can not be destroyed because of some oracle zfs bug.
Only a reeboot seems to be able to fix this. So we just destroy the ones we
can destroy. Logging an error about the problem

=back

=item recvu

use the -u option on the receive end, to keep the destination zfs
filesystems unmounted.

=item pfexec

use 'pfexec' for zfs commands (e.g. when running znapzend as non-priviledged user)

=item sudo

use 'sudo' for zfs commands (e.g. when running znapzend as non-priviledged user)

=back

=item B<--connectTimeout>=I<timeout>

sets the ssh connection timeout (in seconds)

=item B<--autoCreation>

Automatically create a dataset on a destination host if it's not there yet.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLE

To test a new config

 znapzend --debug --noaction --runonce=tank/test

To run as a daemon

 znapzend --daemonize --pidfile=/var/run/znapzend.pid --logto=syslog::daemon
