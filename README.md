ZnapZend is a ZFS centric backup tool to create snapshots and send them
to backup locations. It relies on the ZFS tools snapshot, send and receive
to do its work. It has the built-in ability to manage both local snapshots
as well as remote copies by thinning them out as time progresses.

The ZnapZend configuration is stored as properties in the ZFS filesystem
itself. Keep in mind that while this only regards *local* ZFS properties
of each configured dataset (not "inherited", not "received"), there is
some domain-specific handling of recursion for certain settings based on
presence and value of an `org.znapzend:recursive` property.

Note that while recursive configurations are well supported to set up
backup and retention policies for a whole dataset subtree under the dataset
to which you have applied explicit configuration, at this time pruning of
such trees ("I want every dataset under var except var/tmp") is experimental:
it works, but there may be rough edges which would require more development.

You probably do not want to enable ZnapZend against the root datasets of your
pools due to that, but would have to be more fine-grained in your setup.
This is consistent with (and due to) usage of recursive ZFS snapshots, where
the command is targeted at one dataset and impacts it and all its children,
allowing to get a consistent point-in-time set of snapshots across multiple
datasets.

That said, for several years ZnapZend supports setting a local ZFS property
`org.znapzend:enabled=off` (and only it) in datasets which descend from the
one with a full backup retention schedule configuration (which in turn sets
that its descendants should be handled per `org.znapzend:recursive=off`),
and then exactly these "not-enabled" datasets with `enabled=off` setting
would not be tracked with a long-term history locally or remotely.

> **_NOTE:_**  Implementation-wise, snapshots of the dataset with a full
> backup retention schedule configuration are made recursively so as to be
> a reliable atomic operation. Subsequently snapshots for "not-enabled"
> datasets are pruned. Different ZnapZend versions varied about sending
> such snapshots to a remote destination (e.g. as part of a recursive ZFS
> send stream) and pruning them there afterwards, or avoiding such sending
> operations.

> such snapshots may linger indefinitely and "unexpectedly" consume disk
> space for their uniquely referenced blocks.

Compilation and Installation from source Inztructionz
-----------------------------------------------------

If your distribution does not provide a packaged version of znapzend, or if
you want to get a custom-made copy of znapzend, you will need a compiler and
stuff to build some of the prerequisite perl modules into binary libraries
for the target OS and architecture. For run-time you will need just perl.

The Git checkout includes a pregenerated `configure` script. For a rebuild
of a checkout from scratch you may also want to `./bootstrap.sh` and then
would need the autoconf/automake stack.

* On RedHat you get the necessaries with:
```sh
yum install perl-core
```

* On Ubuntu / Debian with:
```sh
apt-get install perl unzip
```
To also bootstrap on Ubuntu / Debian you may need:
```sh
apt-get install autoconf carton
```

* On Solaris 10 you may need the C compiler from Solaris Studio and gnu-make
since the installed perl version is probably very old and you would likely
have to build some dependency modules. The GNU make is needed instead of Sun
make due to syntax differences. Notably you should reference it if you would
boot-strap the code workspace from scratch:
```sh
MAKE=gmake ./bootstrap.sh
```
Note also that the perl version 5.8.4 provided with Solaris 10 is too old for
the syntax and dependencies of znapzend. As one alternative, take a look at
[CSW packaging of perl-5.10.1 or newer](https://www.opencsw.org/packages/CSWperl/)
and its modules, and other dependencies. To use a non-default perl, set the
`PERL` environment variable to the path of your favorite perl interpreter
prior to running `configure`, e.g.:
```sh
PERL=/opt/perl-32/bin/perl5.32.1 ./configure
```

* On OmniOS/SmartOS you will need perl and gnu-make packages.

* On macOS, if you have not already installed the Xcode command line tools,
you can get them from the command line (Terminal app) with:
```sh
xcode-select --install  ### ...or just install the full Xcode app from the Apple app store
```

With that in place you can now utter:

```sh
ZNAPVER=0.21.1
wget https://github.com/oetiker/znapzend/releases/download/v${ZNAPVER}/znapzend-${ZNAPVER}.tar.gz
tar zxvf znapzend-${ZNAPVER}.tar.gz
cd znapzend-${ZNAPVER}
### ./bootstrap.sh
./configure --prefix=/opt/znapzend-${ZNAPVER}
```

> NOTE: to get the current state of `master` branch without using git tools,
> you should fetch https://github.com/oetiker/znapzend/archive/master.zip

If the `configure` script finds anything noteworthy, it will tell you about it.

If any perl modules are found to be missing, they get installed locally into
the znapzend installation. Your system perl installation will not be modified!

```sh
make
make install
```

Optionally (but recommended) put symbolic links to the installed binaries
in the system PATH, e.g.:

```sh
ZNAPVER=0.21.1
for x in /opt/znapzend-${ZNAPVER}/bin/*; do ln -fs ../../../$x /usr/local/bin/; done
```

Verification Inztructionz
-------------------------

To make sure your resulting set of znapzend code and dependencies plays well
together, you can run unit-tests with:

```sh
make check
```

or

```sh
./test.sh
```

> NOTE: the two methods run same testing scripts with different handling, so
> might behave differently. While that can happen in practice, that would be
> a bug to report and pursue fixing.

```sh
pkg install backup/znapzend
```

Configuration
-------------

Use the [znapzendzetup](doc/znapzendzetup.pod) program to define your backup
settings. They will be stored directly in dataset properties, and will cover
both local snapshot schedule and any number of destinations to send snapshots
to (as well as potentially different retention policies on those destinations).
You can enable recursive configuration, so the settings would apply to all
datasets under the one you configured explicitly.

Example:

    znapzendzetup create --recursive\
       --pre-snap-command="/bin/sh /usr/local/bin/lock_flush_db.sh" \
       --post-snap-command="/bin/sh /usr/local/bin/unlock_db.sh" \
       SRC '7d=>1h,30d=>4h,90d=>1d' tank/home \
       DST:a '7d=>1h,30d=>4h,90d=>1d,1y=>1w,10y=>1month' root@bserv:backup/home

See the [znapzendzetup manual](doc/znapzendzetup.pod) for the full description
of the configuration options.

For remote backup, znapzend uses ssh. Make sure to configure password-free
login (authorized keys) for ssh to the backup target host with an account
sufficiently privileged to manage its ZFS datasets under a chosen destination
root.

For local or remote backup, znapzend can use mbuffer to level out the bursty
nature of ZFS send and ZFS receive features, so it is quite beneficial even
for local backups into another pool (e.g. on removable media or a NAS volume).
It is also configured among the options set by znapzendzetup per dataset.
Note that in order to use larger (multi-gigabyte) buffers you should point
your configuration to a 64-bit binary of the mbuffer program. Sizing the
buffer is a practical art, depending on the size and amount of your datasets
and the I/O speeds of the storage and networking involved. As a rule of thumb,
let it absorb at least a minute of I/O, so while one side of the ZFS dialog
is deeply thinking, another can do its work.

> **_NOTE:_**  Due to backwards-compatibility considerations, the legacy
> `--mbuffer=...` setting applies by default to all destination datasets
> (and to sender, in case of `--mbuffer=/path/to/mbuffer:port` variant).
> This might work if needed programs are all found in `PATH` by the same
> short name, but fails miserably if custom full path names are required
> on different systems.
>
> To avoid this limitation, ZnapZend now allows to specify custom path
> and buffer size settings individually for each source and destination
> dataset in each backup/retention schedule configuration (using the
> `znapzendzetup` program or `org.znapzend:src_mbuffer` etc. ZFS dataset
> properties directly). The legacy configuration properties would now be
> used as fallback defaults, and may emit warnings whenever they are
> applied as such.
>
> With this feature in place, the sender may have the only `mbuffer`
> running, without requiring one on the receiver (e.g. to limit impact
> to RAM usage on the backup server). You may also run an mbuffer on
> each side of the SSH tunnel, if networking latency is random and
> carries a considerable impact.

The remote system does not need anything other than ZFS functionality, an
SSH server, a user account with prepared SSH key based log-in (optionally
an unprivileged one with `zfs allow` settings on a particular target dataset
dedicated to receiving your trees of backed-up datasets), and optionally the
local implementation of the `mbuffer` program. Namely, as a frequently asked
concern: the remote system *does not require* ZnapZend nor its dependencies
(perl, etc.) to be installed. (It may however be installed - e.g. if used for
snapshots of that remote system's own datasets.)

Running
-------

The [znapzend](doc/znapzend.pod) daemon is responsible for doing the actual
backups.

To see if your configuration is any good, run znapzend in noaction mode first.

```sh
znapzend --noaction --debug
```

If you don't want to wait for the scheduler to actually schedule work, you
can also force immediate action by calling

```sh
znapzend --noaction --debug --runonce=<src_dataset>
```

then when you are happy with what you got, start it in daemon mode.

```sh
znapzend --daemonize
```

Best practice is to integrate znapzend into your system startup sequence,
but you can also run it by hand. See the [init/README.md](init/README.md)
for some inspiration.

Running by an unprivileged user
-------------------------------

In order to allow a non-privileged user to use it, the following permissions
are required on the ZFS filesystems (which you can assign with `zfs allow`):

Sending end: `destroy,hold,mount,send,snapshot,userprop`

Receiving end: `create,destroy,mount,receive,userprop`

Caveat Emptor: Receiver with some implementations of ZFS may have further
constraints technologically. For example, non-root users with ZFS on Linux
(as of 2022) may not write into a dataset with property `zoned=on` (including
one inherited or just received -- and `zfs recv -x zoned` or similar options
have no effect to not-replicate it), so this property has to be removed as
soon as it appears on such destination host with the initial replication
stream, e.g. leave a snippet like this running on receiving host before
populating (`zfs send -R ...`) the destination for the first time:

```sh
while ! zfs inherit zoned backup/server1/rpool/rpool/zones/zone1/ROOT ; do sleep 0.1; done
```

You may also have to `zfs allow` by name all standard ZFS properties which
your original datasets customize and you want applied to the copy (e.g. to
eventually restore them), so the non-privileged user may `zfs set` them on
that dataset and its descendants, e.g.:
`compression,mountpoint,canmount,setuid,atime,exec,dedup`
or perhaps you optimized the original storage with the likes of:
`logbias,primarycache,secondarycache,sync`
and note that other options may be problematic long-term if actually used
by the receiving server, e.g.:
`refreservation,refquota,quota,reservation,encryption`

Generally, check the ZnapZend service (or manual run) logs for any errors
and adapt the dataset permissions on the destination pool to satisfy its
implementation specifics.

Running with restricted shell
-----------------------------

As a further security twist on using a non-privileged user on the receiving
host is to restrict its shell so just a few commands may be executed. After
all, you leave its gates open with remote SSH access and a private key without
a passphrase lying somewhere. Several popular shells offer a restricted option,
for example BASH has a `-r` command line option and a `rbash` symlink support.

NOTE: Some SSH server versions also allow to constrain the commands which a
certain key-based session may use, and/or limit from which IP addresses or
DNS names such sessions may be initiated. See documentation on your server's
supported `authorized_keys` file format and key words for that extra layer.

On original server, run `ssh-keygen` to generate an SSH key for the sending
account (`root` or otherwise), possibly into an uniquely named file to use
just for this connection. You can specify custom key file name, non-standard
port, acceptable encryption algorithms and other options with SSH config:
```
# ~/.ssh/config
Host znapdest
        # "HostName" to access may even be "localhost" if the backup storage
        # system can dial in to the systems it collects data from (with SSH
        # port forwarding back to itself) -- e.g. running without a dedicated
        # public IP address (consumer home network, corporate firewall).
        #HostName localhost
        HostName znapdest.domain.org
        Port 22123
        # May list several SSH keys to try:
        IdentityFile /root/.ssh/id_ecdsa-znapdest
        IdentityFile /root/.ssh/id_rsa-znapdest
        User znapzend-server1
        IdentitiesOnly yes
```

On receiving server (example for Proxmox/Debian with ZFS on Linux):

* Create receiving user with `rbash` as the shell, and a home directory:
```sh
useradd -m -s `which rbash` znapzend-server1
```

* Restricted shell denies access to run programs and redirect to path names
  with a path separator (slash character, including `>/dev/null` quiescing).
  This allows to only run allowed shell commands and whatever is resolved
  by `PATH` (read-only after the profile file is interpreted). Typically a
  `bin` directory is crafted with programs you allow to run, but unlike the
  `chroot` jails you don't have to fiddle with dynamic libraries, etc. to
  make the login usable for its purpose.

  * Prepare restricted shell profile (made and owned by `root`) in the user
    home directory:

      ```sh
      # ~znapzend-server1/.rbash_profile
      # Restricted BASH settings
      # https://www.howtogeek.com/718074/how-to-use-restricted-shell-to-limit-what-a-linux-user-can-do/
      PATH="$HOME/bin"
      export PATH
      ```

  * Neuter all other shell profiles so only the restricted one is consulted
  for any way the user logs in (avoid confusion):

      ```sh
      cd ~znapzend-server1/ && (
        rm -f .bash_history .bash_logout .bash_profile .bashrc .profile
        ln -s .rbash_profile .profile
        ln -s .rbash_profile .bashrc
        touch .hush_login )
      ```

  * (As `root`) Prepare `~/bin` for the user:

      ```sh
      mkdir -p ~znapzend-server1/bin
      cd ~znapzend-server1/bin
      for CMD in mbuffer zfs ; do ln -frs "`which "$CMD"`" ./ ; done
      # NOTE: If this user also receives other backups, you can
      # symlink commands needed for that e.g. "rsync" or "git"
      ```

  * Maybe go as far as to make the homedir not writeable to the user?

* Prepare SSH login:
```sh
mkdir -p ~znapzend-server1/.ssh
vi ~znapzend-server1/.ssh/authorized_keys
### Paste public keys from IdentityFile you used on the original server
```

* Restrict access to SSH files (they are ignored otherwise):
```sh
chown -R znapzend-server1: ~znapzend-server1/.ssh
chmod 700 ~znapzend-server1/.ssh
chmod 600 ~znapzend-server1/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

* Unlock the user for ability to login (will use SSH key in practice,
  but unlocking in general may require a password to be set):
```sh
#usermod znapzend-server1 -p "`cat /dev/random | base64 | cut -b 0-20 | head -1`"
usermod -U znapzend-server1
```

* Now is a good time to check that you can log in from the original
  backed-up system to the backup server (using the same account that
  znapzend daemon would use, to save the known SSH host keys), e.g.
  that keys and encryption algorithms are trusted, names are known,
  ports are open... If you defined a `Host znapdest` like above,
  just run:
```sh
# Interactive login?
:; ssh znapdest

# Gets PATH to run stuff?
:; ssh znapdest zfs list
```

* Dedicate a dataset (or several) you would use as destination for the znapzend
  daemon, and set ZFS permissions (see suggestions above), e.g.:
```sh
zfs create backup/server1
zfs allow -du znapzend-server1 create,destroy,mount,receive,userprop backup/server1
```

NOTE: When defining a "backup plan" you would have to specify a basename
for `mbuffer`, since the restricted shell would forbid running a fully
specified pathname, e.g.:
```sh
znapzendzetup edit --mbuffer=mbuffer \
   SRC '6hours=>30minutes,1week=>6hours' rpool/export \
   DST '6hours=>30minutes,1week=>6hours,2weeks=>1day,4months=>1week,10years=>1month' \
       znapdest:backup/server1/rpool/export
```

Running in Container
--------------------

znapzend is also available as docker container image. It needs to be a
privileged container depending on permissions.

```sh
docker run -d --name znapzend --device /dev/zfs --privileged \
    oetiker/znapzend:master
```

To configure znapzend, run in interactive mode:
```sh
docker exec -it znapzend /bin/sh
$ znapzendzetup create ...
# After exiting, restart znapzend container or send the HUP signal to
# reload config
```

By default, znapzend in container runs with `--logto /dev/stdout`. If you
wish to add different arguments, overwrite them at the end of the command:

```sh
docker run --name znapzend --device /dev/zfs --privileged \
    oetiker/znapzend:master znapzend --logto /dev/stdout --runonce --debug
```

Be sure not to daemonize znapzend in the container, as that exits the
container immediately.

Troubleshooting
---------------

By default a znapzend daemon would log its progress and any problems to
local syslog as a daemon facility, so if the service misbehaves - that is
the first place to look. Alternately, you can set up the service manifest
to start the daemon with other logging configuration (e.g. to a file or
to stderr) and perhaps with debug level enabled.

If your snapshots on the source dataset begin to pile up and not cleaned
according to your expectations from the schedule you have defined, look
into the logs particularly for summaries like `ERROR: suspending cleanup
source dataset because X send task(s) failed` followed by each failed
dataset name and a short verdict (e.g. `snapshot(s) exist on destination,
but no common found on source and destination`). See above in the logs
for more details, and/or disable the znapzend service temporarily (to
avoid run-time conflicts) and run a manual replication:

```sh
znapzend --debug --runonce=<src_dataset>/failed/child --inherited
```

...to collect even more under-the-hood details about what is happening and
to get ideas about fixing that. See the manual page about `--recursive` and
`--inherited` modifiers to `--runonce` mode for more information.

Typical issues include:

* At least one destination is offline;
* At least one destination is full and can not be written into;
* A destination on SAN (iSCSI) or local device had transport issues and
  ZFS suspended all write operations until you fix and `zpool clear` it;
* Source is full (or exceeded quota) and can not be written into, so the
  new snapshots to send can not be made until you delete older ones;
* There are too many snapshots to clean up on source or destination, and
  the operation fails because the command line becomes too long. You can
  try running with `--features=oracleMode` to process each snapshot name
  as a separate command, that would be slower but more reliable in such
  situation;
* There are snapshots on destination, but none common with the source
  so incremental replication can not proceed without destroying much
  or all of the destination. Note this can be looking at snapshot names
  filtered by the pattern your backup schedule would create, and other
  znapzend options and/or a run of native `zfs send|zfs recv` would help
  if your destination has manually named snapshots that are common with
  your source.

> NOTE: Do not forget to re-enable the znapzend service after you have
> rectified the problem that prevented normal functionality.

One known problem relates to automated backups of datasets whose source
can get cloned, renamed and promoted - typically boot environments (the
rootfs of your OS installation and ZBE for local zones on illumos/Solaris
systems behave this way to benefit from snapshots during upgrades and to
allow easily switching back to older version if an update went bad).
At this time (see [issue #503](https://github.com/oetiker/znapzend/issues/503))
znapzend does not handle such datasets as branches of a larger ZFS tree
and with `--autoCreation` mode in place just makes new complete datasets
on the destination pool. On one hand this is wasteful for space (unless
you use deduplication which comes with other costs), and on another the
histories of snapshots seen in the same-named source and destination
datasets can eventually no longer expose a "last-common snapshot" and
this causes an error like `snapshot(s) exist on destination, but no common
found on source and destination`.

In case you tinkered with ZFS attributes that store ZnapZend retention
policies, or potentially if you have a severe version mismatch of ZnapZend
(e.g. update from a PoC or very old version), ```znapzendzetup list``` is
quite useful to non-intrusively discover whatever your current version can
consider to be discrepancies in your active configuration.

Finally note that yet-unreleased code from the master branch may include
fixes to problems you face (see
[recent commits](https://github.com/oetiker/znapzend/commits/master) and
[closed pull requests](https://github.com/oetiker/znapzend/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)),
but also may introduce new bugs.
