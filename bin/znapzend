# The default value was set so low on purpose -- we need it that way and anyone

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ZnapZend is a snapshot based zfs backup daemon creating snapshots on a
scheduled basis on the source filesystem and on destination filesystems.

ZnapZend reads its configuration from custom properties in the fileset. Use
L<znapzendzetup> to set these properties.

=over

=item B<-d>, B<--debug>

talk a lot while running. Sends debug messages to stderr.

=item B<-n>, B<--noaction>

don't do any actions which have lasting effect. Ideal to try our new new
configurations together with B<--debug>

=item B<--nodestroy>

do all changes to the filesystem except destroy old snapshots

=item B<--logto>={B<syslog::>I<facility>|I<filepath>}

send logs out to either syslog or a logfile. Default is to send logs to
B<syslog::daemon> when runing daemonized. When running in debug mode, the
logs will go to STDERR by default.

Examples:

 --logto=/var/log/znapzend.log
 --logto=syslog::daemon

=item B<--loglevel>={B<debug>|B<info>|B<warning>|B<err>|B<alert>}

Define the log level when logging to file. Default is debug.

=item B<--pidfile>=I<path>

write a pid file when running in daemon mode
B<pidfile> defaults to I</var/run/znapzend.pid> if no pidfile is given

=item B<--daemonize>

Fork into the background.

=item B<--runonce>=I<fileset>

run one round on source I<fileset>. This is very useful for testing.
Use it in connection with B<--noaction> and B<--debug> while
testing your new configuration

=item B<--features>=I<feature1>,I<feature2>,...

enables enhanced zfs features not supported by all zfs implementations.
Do not enable features unless you are sure your zfs supports it

Available features:

=over

=item oracleMode

working around the following zfs issues we have seen on oracle:

=over

=item *

The multi snapshot destroy syntax is not available. So stick to destroying
them individually.

=item *

Sometimes a snapshot can not be destroyed because of some oracle zfs bug.
Only a reeboot seems to be able to fix this. So we just destroy the ones we
can destroy. Logging an error about the problem

=back

=item recvu

use the -u option on the receive end, to keep the destination zfs
filesystems unmounted.

=item pfexec

use 'pfexec' for zfs commands (e.g. when running znapzend as non-priviledged user)

=item sudo

use 'sudo' for zfs commands (e.g. when running znapzend as non-priviledged user)

=item compressed

use 'compressed' to add options -Lce to the zfs send command
If a source and destination volume are both using compression, zfs send will, by
default, decompress the data before sending. Zfs recv will then compress it again before 
writing it to disk. Using -c will skip the unnecessary decompress-compress stages.
This decreases CPU load on both source and destination as well as reduce network
bandwidth. The -L option is for large block support and -e is for embedded data support.

=back

=item B<--connectTimeout>=I<timeout>

sets the ssh connection timeout (in seconds)

=item B<--autoCreation>

Automatically create a dataset on a destination host if it's not there yet.

=item B<--timeWarp>=x

Shift ZnapZends sense of time into the future by x seconds.

The practical application if this function is to determine what will happen at some future point in time.
This can be useful for testing but also when running in noaction and debug mode to determine which
snapshots would be created and removed at some future point in time.

=back

=item B<--maxParallelism>=x

Limits the number of active worker processes to x.

Both snapshotting and sending snapshots to destination creates a separate process for every backup set.
Using maxParallelism you can set the maximal number of active processes to prevent overload of the server
running znapzend. Default limit is 2.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLE

To test a new config

 znapzend --debug --noaction --runonce=tank/test

To see what is going to happen in one hour

 znapzend --debug --noaction --timeWarp=3600 --runonce=tank/test

To run as a daemon

 znapzend --daemonize --pidfile=/var/run/znapzend.pid --logto=syslog::daemon
